        <h1>About Us </h1>
        <p>
            Dance Academy was created to help dance competitions easily find their next judging panel. Our judges are
            in-demand, professional adjudicators, teachers, and dancers, who have prior experience behind the table, as
            well as vast knowledge in all styles of dance. The judges selected to be represented by DA are required to
            go through a pre-screening process which evaluates their knowledge in multiple forms of dance. Our roster of
            talented professionals will help your competition become one to remember, by not only providing fair &
            accurate scoring, but informative and detailed critiques. Our goal at DA is to supply Competitions with
            pre-screened, educated Adjudicators who have working industry knowledge in all styles of dance, as well as
            teachers of all ages and levels in the classroom. We work together, towards professional excellence in
            exploring dance in various forms such as educational, research, artistic and commercial ventures. We
            constantly strive for efficiency and customer satisfaction. Our talented team of professional dancers and
            instructors have all been handpicked and personally trained by our founders Terence Lewis and Mahrukh
            Dumasia; and receive ongoing coaching and regular assessments to ensure that that their skills are
            up-to-date.</p>
